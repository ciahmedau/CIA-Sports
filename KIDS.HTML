                  <P>There is no question that 
                  children, and the earlier they start, the better. But is it 
                  advisable for 6-year-olds to play team football? Should you 
                  encourage an uncoordinated child to take up gymnastics? It's 
                  important to remember that it's OK if children are not 
                  interested in certain sports as long as they pursue activities 
                  that help them stay physically fit. The key is finding 
                  activities they like to do, that are fun, and that get them 
                  moving! And don't overlook the other benefits your child will 
                  be receiving from exercise - including learning to share, 
                  making friends, and developing self-esteem.</P>

		<BR>Try to 
                  concentrate on your child's successes, rather than her 
                  failures. Your child may not be able to swim well, but she may 
                  be a terrific skater and basketball player. Praise what she 
                  does well and provide plenty of opportunities for her to 
                  succeed. Introduce new activities, especially if she shows 
                  interest. Try to attend your child's games and meets as much 
                  as possible to encourage her and provide support. Whenever 
                  possible, parents should participate in fitness activities 
                  <B>with</B> their children. When a family rides bicycles or 
                  snowboards together, parents act as role models and everyone 
                  has fun and gets some exercise. What could be 
              better?
