<h3>News of Golg</h3>
<p>Tiger Woods may have won the year's first two majors and he may be the greatest player of all time. But the pressure of winning golf's coveted Grand Slam is something even he may find too tough.<br>


Granted, he has won all four majors in a row before, but victory in the Open Championship at Muirfield and the PGA at Hazeltine would make him the first professional ever to achieve the feat in a calendar year. Not much pressure, then.<br>


   
Woods is halfway to the coveted Grand Slam (Reuters)   
Woods has been trying to take some of the pressure off himself, claiming his feat of four in a row means he has already won the slam, but as a great student of the sport, he knows he's close to achieving something which would give him golfing immortality.<br>


And the fact is, the closer he gets, the more the pressure will build.<br>


You only have to look at how much his Masters victory of 2000 - his fourth major in a row - took out of him to see what kind of pressure he must already be under.<br>


Following that, he never really had a chance to win the other three majors that year, admitting he was mentally exhausted.<br>


Greg Norman, who knows something about the pressure of the game, described winning the Grand Slam as an enormous task.<br>


Norman, who achieved the 'Saturday Slam' in 1986 when he led all four majors after the third round, only to win just one of them, was speaking after watching Woods win the US Open on Sunday to add to his Masters crown.<br>


"Even with his victory here, it's an enormous task. I just can't put any odds on it," Norman said<br>. 


<b>"You win the first one, OK. You win the second one, the pressure quadruples. You win the third it's exponential pressure. I know he's great and I know he's got a good mind, but I'll tell you what, everyone's going to want to do more to try and stop him. It's just going to be enormous pressure on him."</b><br>


However, if anyone can do it, according to Norman, then Woods can.<br>


<b>"I do like his chances, though. He's hitting the ball solid. He's got a lot of confidence. And the other guys haven't done it to him yet."</b><br>


For the second major in succession, Woods was able to win without being pushed hard by anyone in the final round. His fellow professionals, it would seem, are in awe. 


<b>"To be quite honest, no one's thrown a good round at him in any final round of a major,"</b> Norman said. 


<b>"Nobody's really come and challenged him, stepped up to the plate and thrown a 65 or a 64 at him. He's gone out there and shot under par without a whole lot of pressure or people going at him. </b><br>


"And when you're playing with a 15-shot lead, you'd expect that someone would come at him firing left, right and center. It will be interesting to see what happens."
