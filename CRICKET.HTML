Australia need to find a way to survive dangerous spells from bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar if they are to successfully defend the World Cup next year, captain Ricky Ponting said on Thursday. <br>


   
Shoaib Ahktar routed the Aussies at the Gabba (Action Images)   
"He bowled well, he bowled quick and he got his deliveries in the right areas," Ponting told reporters after Shoaib had taken five for 25 to bowl Australia out for 165 chasing Pakistan's 256 for seven in Wednesday's third and deciding one-day international. <br> 


"When you're bowling 150 kilometres an hour (94 miles an hour) and swinging the ball you're always going to be hard to play. But we've got to find a way to combat that when the World Cup comes around.  <br>


"We have to identify when someone is bowling well and get through those tough times. We couldn't do that this time and he ripped the heart out of our innings.  <br>


"We're losing wickets in patches as well and we haven't got partnerships at the top of the order, and that's something we need when the World Cup comes around," said Ponting.  <br>


Shoaib, one of the world's fastest bowlers, struck four times as Australia slumped from 44 for one to 83 for six.  <br>


The three-match series, including two games played under a closed roof at Melbourne's Docklands Stadium, attracted only 40,000 spectators, prompting speculation over the future of the winter cricket concept in Australia.  <br>


A three-game winter series played against South Africa in Melbourne two years ago drew almost 95,000 fans.  <br>


"We would have liked more people to attend but we'll weigh all of that up (the success of the series) after we've done some market research," Australian Cricket Board chief executive James Sutherland told reporters.  <br>
