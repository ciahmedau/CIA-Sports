The 28-year-old ACT Brumbie will resume his half-back partnership with skipper George Gregan against the French after injury forced him to miss the weekend's narrow victory over the New Zealand Maoris.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">Larkham comes in for Elton Flatley who's relegated to the bench with Andrew walker dropping into the A squad for next Tuesday's game against the French.</P>

<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">Ben Tune's continued absence on the left wing opens the door for Sailor who claims his first cap, the 773rd person to play for Australia.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">He becomes the second player after Walker to have represented Australia at league and union. Uncapped Mat Rogers, also a former league player, earns a place on the bench.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">But Larkham had one eye on next year's World Cup when he looked forward to the visit of Bernard Laporte's French side. </P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">He said the Wallabies were still trying to find their feet and establish a style under new coach Eddie Jones but he was confident everything would fall into place.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">''We're not expecting a miracle change overnight, it's something that's going to happen over a couple of test matches,'' Larkham said. </P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">''Heading into the World Cup next year, we want to have our own distinct game plan and everyone needs to be able to follow that.''</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">Jones, meanwhile, was confident Sailor could make the leap to the top class international game.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">''It's been a rapid rise through the ranks for Wendell but he's passed the test at Sevens, Super 12, Australia A and of course the Wallabies last week,'' said Jones.</P>
<P CLASS="body"></P>
<P CLASS="body">''He's a big devastating runner who will only get better,'' added Jones.</P>
